# Racket for Visual Studio Code

This is a package for supporting rich [Racket](racket-lang.org) support for Visual Studio Code. Other implementations of Racket grammar didn't have full colorization for the language and because we develop [Kary Themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karyfoundation.theme-karyfoundation-themes) to be fully colorized we developed this package to offer you a much more awesome experience.

This package also features an extension to inteliSense to support racket/scheme "kebab" identifiers and also other racket names such as `string->keyword` or like `#lang`
